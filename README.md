# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to create a web app that displays Mars facts.  To do this, we used Beautiful Soups and Splinter to scrape full resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store them in MongoDB database, and use a web app to display the data.

This is the original app created to display Mars facts.  In order to get the most recent Mars news, we scraped data from:

To get the displayed surface picture and facts table, we used:
