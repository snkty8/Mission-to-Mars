# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to create a web app that displays Mars facts.  To do this, we used Beautiful Soups and Splinter to scrape full resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store them in MongoDB database, and use a web app to display the data.
